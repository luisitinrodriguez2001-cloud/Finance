# Finance

This project hosts simple finance calculators served from a small Express server.

The repository previously included an AI chat demo, but that feature has been removed.

The Data tab can load World Bank indicators and Yahoo Finance stock quotes without any API keys.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Theme

The `theme/` directory contains an independent, copy-ready UI template. It preserves the profile header, social links, fun facts ribbon (without facts), and gradient background while excluding tabs and data.
