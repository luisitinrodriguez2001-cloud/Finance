# Simulation Sources

This document summarizes key references for Monte Carlo simulations used in this project, including definitions, retirement success-rate interpretation, and typical trial counts.

## Monte Carlo simulation
Monte Carlo simulation uses repeated random sampling to model the probability of different outcomes. It is widely applied in finance to project uncertain returns and assess risk.

## Retirement success rate
A retirement Monte Carlo "success rate" represents the percentage of simulation runs where a portfolio maintains a positive balance for the entire planning horizon.

- [T. Rowe Price \u2013 "Monte Carlo simulations: what a good success rate looks like"](https://www.troweprice.com/financial-intermediary/us/en/insights/articles/2022/q2/monte-carlo-simulations-retirement-planning.html) — discusses interpreting success percentages. \u00a9 T. Rowe Price; article available online for reference.

## Typical trial counts
Financial planners commonly run thousands of trials to generate a stable distribution of outcomes. Tool providers often cite ranges between 1,000 and 10,000 simulations.

- [Vanguard \u2013 "Plan for retirement using Monte Carlo simulations"](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/plan-for-retirement-using-monte-carlo-simulations) — notes use of large-scale runs (e.g., 5,000+). \u00a9 Vanguard; article publicly accessible.
